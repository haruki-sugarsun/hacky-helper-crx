# Design Doc: Terminology, Concepts, and Relations

## Session

- A manageable unit
- A session can be either "named" or "unnamed".
- A session can have some metadata, e.g. ordering, createdAt, updatedAt.

### Named Sessions

-

### Open Named Sessions

- A session
- Hence, associated with a window in the current browser.

### Closed Named Sessions

- A Named Session which only exists

### Unamed Sessions

## UI

## Data Storage/Synchronization

### In-memory/Local Storage

(Technically, it might or might not be in-memory, but we call this layer sometimes in-memory or just local)

-

### Backend Storage

- Effectively this is Chrome Browser's Bookmark folders for now.
