# Agent Rule: Task Planning & Documentation

## Principle

- For any new feature or change:
  - Document the task plan in a dedicated file in `taskdocs/` before implementation.
  - Analyze the existing codebase relevant to the task before making changes.
  - Summarize and document the implementation plan in the task file prior to coding.
- This guarantees traceability, clarity, and maintainability for all development work.

A well-documented plan is the warp drive of sustainable development.
