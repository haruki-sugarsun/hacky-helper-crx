## Strategy to build/execute a Strategy

- PLAN phase:
  - Read the related files as much as possible.
  - Review and break down the plan in "Strategy and Next Steps" and add details as much as possible.
    - Refer the "Example Plan" for example steps.
  - Repeat until we get to the confidence about what to do and where to change.
- EXECUTE Phase:
  - Work on the "Strategy and Next Steps" items, with checking whether each change plan is already done or not.

## Example Plan

1. (filename.ext) Define method `function a()`.
2. (filename.ext) Describe the behavior of the method `function a()` as unittest.
3. (filename.ext) In the method `function a()`, implement handling X.
