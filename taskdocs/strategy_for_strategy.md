## Strategy to build/execute a Strategy

- METAPLAN Phase:
  - Find a single actinoable plan and start planning in `taskdoc`.
  - Prepare or edit a corrensponding file in `taskdoc` directory which contains a file per a plan.
  - A plan file in `taskdoc` shouid contain a "Strategy and Next Steps" section which list up the detailed changes as detailed as possible.
- PLAN phase:
  - Read the related files as much as possible.
  - Review and break down the plan in "Strategy and Next Steps" and add details as much as possible.
    - Refer the "Example Plan" for example steps.
  - Repeat until we get to the confidence about what to do and where to change.
- EXECUTE Phase:
  - Work on the "Strategy and Next Steps" items, with checking whether each change plan is already done or not.
