This is a work stack. Take the top one and process it.

## Strategy and Next Steps

- n/a

## Fallback Strategy if No No Next Steps

- Find a TODO which requires the smallest changes and work on the implementation.

  - You may use `find *.html src/ *.md designdocs/ -type f | xargs grep TODO | shuf | head -n100`
  - PRIVATE_MEMO.md also has ideas.

## Just Idea Parking Lot

We have unstructured, just-idea notes here:

- Drag-n-Drop for Tab Migrations.
- Tabs UI updates based on the window/tabs/sessions(open tabs/saved bookmarks) updates.
- Use some webfont for emojis?
- Make sure to generate keywords only for the generateKeywords function maybe by specifiying JSON output? -ã€€Show the current LLMTasks status in the popup? e.g. number of the pending tasks, currently-running task etc.
- Open the sidepanel from popup.
- Hot key to trigger the sidepanel feature?
- Keeping pinned tabs feature following the active window. Refer the old Hacky-Tab-Enhancer impl.
- Support migrate to a closed Named Session. We may update the existing UI in Tabs UI or Popup with a search for named sessions.
- Improve session restoration on browser start. We can refer the sessionId in URL, but it is not working well yet.
- Action label for "force sync" session should say "to Backend".
- Replace the new-tab-page with the minimal UI like Tabs UI. ref: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/ui/override-chrome-pages?hl=ja
- Allow migration to the closed named session. Migrated tab is just added to the Open Tab in the chosen (closed named) session.
- Function and hotkey to copy the current page title+URL for easier sharing.
- Add a flag for saved bookmarks and open them automatically when the session gets activated.
- In the search result, show the name of the session the open tab belongs to.
- Session Name should be reflected if updated by other instance. We can compare the timestamp metadata.
- Allow the user to rename the saved bookmarks.
- Search for the "saved bookmarks" as well.
- Close Window in the action menu in Tabs UI.
- Refactoring Tasks:
  - Replace config accesses to read values with CONFIG_RO.
  - Replace sendMessage usage with service-worker-interface.ts, service-worker-handler.ts, and service-worker-messages.ts.
- Search for the "saved bookmarks" as well.
- Close Window in the action menu in Tabs UI.
- Style in Settings UI.
